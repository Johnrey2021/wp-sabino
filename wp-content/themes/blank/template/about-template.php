			<h1>About KAPEtan's Tea House</h1>
			<h3>KAPEtan's Tea House is a food service company established in 2000, specializing in
			<br> healthy milk tea. The concept is inspired mainly by Asia’s unique culture of tea 
			<br>drinking – which in many Asian countries, is an important part of a ceremony in 
			<br>entertaining customers, that reflects a sign of respect and value for the guests.
			<br>
			<br>
			KAPEtan's Tea House drinks are guaranteed made from 100% freshly brewed loose-leaf 
			<br>teas of high quality, made exciting by different flavors and mixes for a fun and 
			<br>healthier lifestyle.</h3>
			<br>
			<h2>Our Goal</h2>
			<br>
			<h3>Our main goal in establishing the company is to bring the joy of healthy living 
			<br>through tea to the hearts of Filipinos. Since then, we have committed ourselves 
			<br>to being the best in our field.</h3>
